**They are great. I really want to work for them.** 

It reads .raw files and convert them to .csv files. In future to PDF and other formats.

Tool is localized in czech languange. In future I will localize it in english, deutsch, polski, français and español.
I am planning to convert the tool into a library / NuGet package.

**Tool is still under development!**
